# hello-world
Just another new world

I'm a new soul, I came to this strange world, hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take..
But since I came here, felt the joy and the fear, finding myself making every possible mistake.
See I'm a young soul in this very strange world, hoping I could learn a bit about what is true and fake..
But why all this hate? Try to communicate, finding trust and love is not always easy to make.
This is a happy end 'cause you don't understand. 
Everything you have done, why is everything so wrong?
This is a happy end, come and give me your hand, I'll take you far away...
